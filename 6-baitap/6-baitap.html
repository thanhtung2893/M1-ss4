                  how elements are positioned and laid out, 
                  what background images or background colors are to be used,

            <p>Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to
                a parent element will also apply to all children elements
                 within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text 
                 to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements 
                 within the body will also get the same color nless you specify
                  something else</p>
